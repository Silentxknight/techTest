# 4D Technical Assessment - React/Node.js

## Introduction

Welcome to the technical assessment for the 4D Engineering team. This assessment simulates a real-world project scenario where you'll work on Admin Insurance, our document management system designed for large organizations.

## Project Overview

Admin Insurance helps organizations manage employee documentation processes across multiple countries. The system handles form submissions, document processing, and maintains data security and accessibility standards.

## Current System Components

1. Landing Page: Basic introduction and navigation
2. Form Page: Form submission 
3. Results Page: Data search

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm (v9 or higher)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd admin-insurance
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
# Start both frontend and backend servers
npm run dev:full

# Or start them separately:
npm run dev        # Frontend only
npm run server     # Backend only
```

4. Access the application:
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:3000

│   └── e2e/              # End-to-end tests
└── tickets/              # Implementation tickets
```

## Testing

The project includes both WebDriverIO and Playwright for testing. Here's an example test:

```typescript
// tests/e2e/playwright/form.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('form submission workflow', async ({ page }) => {
  // Navigate to form page
  await page.goto('/form');
  
  // Fill required fields
  await page.fill('input[name="firstName"]', 'John');
  await page.fill('input[name="lastName"]', 'Doe');
  await page.fill('input[name="email"]', 'john.doe@example.com');
  
  // Submit form
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
  
  // Verify submission
  await expect(page.locator('text=Form submitted successfully')).toBeVisible();
});
```

Run tests using:
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run specific test suite
npm run test:wdio
npm run test:playwright
```

## Implementation Tickets

Detailed specifications for each implementation task can be found in the `tickets/` directory. Please select the tickets assigned to you and implement them according to the specifications.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on:
- Code architecture and design patterns
- Component structure and reusability
- Testing implementation
- Documentation quality
- Performance optimization techniques

## Note About AI Tools

While you may use AI tools like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot for assistance, ensure that you fully understand and can explain all code implementations. The core solution should reflect your technical thinking and problem-solving approach.

Challenge: Implement an Advanced Search and File Upload System

📌 Overview

The goal of this challenge was to enhance the Results Page by implementing two key functionalities:
	1.	Advanced Search API - Allows users to search for documents using complex search criteria (e.g., field-specific searches, exact phrase matching, and numeric range filters).
	2.	File Upload API - Enables users to upload PDF, CSV, and TXT files, process their contents, and return extracted data.

These enhancements improve document management by providing powerful search capabilities and automated data processing for uploaded files.

💡 Solution Breakdown

🔹 Part 1: Advanced Search System

🎯 Challenge:
	•	Users needed a way to search documents using advanced queries.
	•	The system had to support:
✅ Exact phrase search ("John Doe")
✅ Field-based search (employeeId:ABC-12345)
✅ Numeric range filters (salary:40000..60000)
	•	The search had to be efficient and work in real-time with the Results Page.

🛠️ Solution:
	•	Implemented a new /api/search endpoint in the Express server.
	•	Used regular expressions (RegEx) to parse user queries into structured filters.
	•	Applied these filters to the in-memory submissions dataset to return matching results.

🔑 How It Works:
	•	Users enter a search query in the frontend (e.g., employeeId:ABC-12345).
	•	The frontend sends a request:
```typescript
GET /api/search?q=employeeId:ABC-12345
```

	•	The backend parses the query, extracts filters, and searches for matching records.
	•	Filtered results are sent back to the frontend for display.

🚀 Key Achievements:

✅ Users can search using natural and structured queries.
✅ The system supports exact matches, field-based filters, and numeric ranges.
✅ Real-time updates ensure a smooth user experience.

🔹 Part 2: File Upload and Processing System

🎯 Challenge:
	•	Users needed a way to upload files (PDFs, CSVs, and TXT files) and extract data from them.
	•	The system had to:
✅ Accept only valid file types.
✅ Process each file type correctly (e.g., extract text from PDFs, parse CSVs).
✅ Provide clear error handling if an invalid file is uploaded.

🛠️ Solution:
	•	Implemented a Multer-based file upload system in Express.
	•	Set a 10MB file limit and restricted uploads to PDF, CSV, and TXT formats.
	•	Used pdf-parse for PDF extraction, csv-parser for CSV parsing, and fs (File System) for reading TXT files.

🔑 How It Works:
	1.	Users upload a file through the frontend.
	2.	The file is stored in the uploads/ directory.
	3.	The backend detects the file type and processes it accordingly:
	•	PDF: Extracts text using pdf-parse.
	•	CSV: Parses rows using csv-parser.
	•	TXT: Reads file contents directly.
	4.	The extracted data is returned to the user, and the file is deleted from the server.

🚀 Key Achievements:

✅ Users can upload multiple file types (PDF, CSV, TXT).
✅ The system automatically extracts and processes file data.
✅ Efficient error handling ensures only valid files are accepted.

🎯 Why This Approach?

1️⃣ Simplicity & Performance
	•	Used in-memory filtering for fast search without requiring a database.
	•	File processing is handled asynchronously to avoid blocking server operations.

2️⃣ Scalability & Flexibility
	•	The search system can easily be extended to support new fields.
	•	The upload system can be modified to store files permanently or process new file formats.

3️⃣ User Experience & Error Handling
	•	Real-time filtering improves search speed.
	•	Clear error messages ensure users understand what went wrong.
